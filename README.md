# Customer-lifetime-value
Step-by-step machine learning project covering data preprocessing, feature engineering, isolation forest, XGBoost, K-means, SHAP, and deployment using Flask and Ngrok in Colab.

    All Customers Are Not Equal. Mark Jeffery

As almost 20 percent of customers generate 80 percent of the revenue.

## What is Customer Lifetime Value?

    In marketing, customer lifetime value is a prognostication of the net profit contributed to the whole future relationship with a customer. wiki

Tailor effective Value-based marketing strategies can help you retain your loyal customers for as long as possible.

There are many ways to calculate CLTV, but the most recommended formula by data scientists like Barış Karaman is:

### Lifetime Value = Total Gross Revenue — Total Cost

The main objective of this project is to develop an Xgboost model to predict customer lifetime value (CLTV) and use this prediction to determine which cluster the customer belongs to.

For this project, we will analyse historical transactional data and perform feature engineering to predict the customer lifetime value (CLTV) over the next 90 days.

### Our Project Steps: 
    Knowing the Dataset.
    Data Preprocessing and Analysis.
    Building Xgboost and performing shap values.
    Building PCA and K-Means.
    Deployment using Flask and Ngrok.
